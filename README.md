# CS014_Data-Structures_PRACTICE

## Purpose

Through helping friends and like-minded CS students, I have decided to go through UCR's Data Structures curriculum as practice to refresh my coding abilities.

This practice is for practice (only) and is not taken for credit at the University of California, Riverside.
